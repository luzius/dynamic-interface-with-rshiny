The aim of this project was to program a dynamic user interface with R shiny. After clicking an action button on the landing page the user interface changes completely; all of the previous ui-elements are replaced by new ones. In addition the data input from the landing page is added to a google spreadsheet. The (updated) spreadsheet is read and displayed as an new ui-element after clicking the action button.
